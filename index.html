        <p id="paragraph1">He was born on the 1st of April 1936 in India,<br>
           Bhopal State. By 1952, Abdul Qadeer had<br> completed
           his matriculation from a local school<br> in Bhopal.
           Then he took the Sindh Mail train to<br> Pakistan
           from India, mainly because the government<br> had
           turned against certain groups of people and<br>
           there was a lot of religious violence that took<br>
           place during that time. </p>
